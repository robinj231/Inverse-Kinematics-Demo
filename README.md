This inverse kinematics demo is an interactive program in which the user can interact with implementations of three-dimensional inverse kinematics. There is the spider demo, in which the user can control a spider character with realistically moving limbs. The other two demos are arms in a 3D space, and using the mouse the user can place points in the 3D space, which the arm will then reach out towards.
